# Learning OS development

This repo is just a personal stash of things that I've learned trying to understand how modern day operating systems are programmed and work. It might not be 100% structured logically but take it as my learning process around it all.
Feel free to poke around.

## Structure

* Chapter 1 was my first try at creating a basically empty boot sector for legacy x86 BIOS
* Chapter 2 further familiarization of assembler language (x86): stack, conditional jumps, interrupt output, functions etc.
* Chapter 3 memory access, segmentation etc
* Chapter 4 32-bit protected mode
* Chapter 5 C-assembly translation and study
* Chapter 6 trying to create a simple kernel
* Chapter 7 Programming my own low level device drivers
* Chapter 8 Long mode: How to get to 64-bit
* Chapter 9 UEFI: my first attempt to do anything with UEFI
* Chapter 10 Loading kernel with UEFI
* Chapter 11 Linux kernel: Trying to understand it with the knowledge I gained now
